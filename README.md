# Atomizer

A Minimalistic customizable python based sticky note thingy!, enjoy the ✨ Minimalism ✨ and customize the notepad to your hearts content! (doesn't store anything/forgets what you wrote once closed)

Why is atomizer a sticky note app?
- I am working on a app called Atomizer+ which is a full fledge text editor, with tabs line count and other shit!

---

if you want to run this via python (executables coming soon) you'll need to do the following:

first go to your terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/planetjunkie/Atomizer/` after that go cd to the folder and cd to the src folder, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, once it installs everything just type `python atomizer.py`

kaboom you are done!
